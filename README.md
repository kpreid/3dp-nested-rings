An easy-to-print fidget toy made of permanently nested rings that can tumble and shift around.

Two basic styles are available; the biconical style allows the rings to shift along their axis while still nesting solidly. The spherical style has a close fit.

Both styles allow the rings to tumble and be spun like in a gimbal.

I highly recommend printing the rings with colored edge bands by changing the filament during printing. There is an option to have a thin middle band for transparency.
